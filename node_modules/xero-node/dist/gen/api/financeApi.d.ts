The user has discretion as to which accounting period the transaction relates to.    The ‘balance date’  will control the latest maximum date of transactions included in the aggregate numbers.  Balance date does not affect the CurrentStatement object, as this will always return the most recent statement before asAtSystemDate (if specified)
     * @param asAtSystemDate date, yyyy-MM-dd     If no parameter is provided, the current date will be used.    The ‘as at’ date will return transactions based on the  creation date.  It reflects the date the transactions were entered into Xero, not the accounting date.  The ‘as at’ date can not be overridden by the user.  This can be used to estimate a ‘historical frequency of reconciliation’.    The ‘as at’ date will affect the current statement in the response, as any candidate statements created after this date will be filtered out.  Thus the current statement returned will be the most recent statement prior to the specified ‘as at’ date.  Be aware that neither the begin date, nor the balance date, will affect the current statement.    Note;  information is only presented when system architecture allows, meaning historical cash validation information will be an estimate. In addition, delete events are not aware of the ‘as at’ functionality in this endpoint, meaning that transactions deleted at the time the API is accessed will be considered to always have been deleted.
     * @param beginDate date, yyyy-MM-dd     If no parameter is provided, the aggregate results will be drawn from the user’s total history.
